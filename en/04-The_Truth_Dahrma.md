 The Truth: *Dharma *
=====================

As people who have struggled with addiction, we’re already intimately
familiar with the truth of suffering. Even if we’ve never heard of the
Buddha, at some level we already understand the core of his teachings:
that in this life, there is suffering.

It can be incredibly liberating to hear this said so plainly and
directly. No one is trying to convince or convert us. No one is telling
us we have to believe something. No one is sugarcoating our experience.
For once, it feels like we’re being told the truth.

The Buddha also taught the way to free ourselves from this suffering.
The heart of these teachings (which we call the Dharma) is the Four
Noble Truths. These truths, and the corresponding commitments, are the
foundation of our program:

1.  There is suffering. We commit to understanding the truth of
    suffering.

2.  There is a cause of suffering. We commit to understanding that
    craving leads to suffering.

3.  There is an end to suffering. We commit to understanding and
    experiencing that less craving leads to less suffering.

4.  There is a path that leads to the end of suffering. We commit to
    cultivating the path.

Like a map that shows us the path, these truths help us find our way in
recovery.
